# XQuery API

Before data from XQuery API can be consumed by a client, a *Project* must be
requested and activated via the [Projects API](/#projects-api-xquery-hydra). The `<PROJECT-ID>` and `<API-KEY>` of
an active project must be provided in API calls to XQuery API
as proof that the calls are being made from an active project.
